# World Wide Weather
Module 6

## Overview of the Analysis

Purpose of this project was to develop an app that would allow a user to select travel destinations based on a set of temperature parameters.  This was accomplished using
python, jupyter notebooks, weather data api, as well as several of the google mapping apis.

## Results

Different maps that were created included:

Searching for locations based on temperateure requirements:

## Summary

In summary using a combination of python scripting and api's we were able to demonstrate a way for users to pick travel destinations based on temperature requirements.  This required pulling latitude and longitudes and getting wether information from weather data apis then plotting them using a google api.
